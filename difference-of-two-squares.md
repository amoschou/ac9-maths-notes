# Difference of two squares

> Before reading about binomial product, you need to know the following:
> * Binomial product (FOIL rule): $\left(a + b\right)\left(c + d\right) = ac + ad + bc + bd$

The difference of to squares is a special case of the binomial product, where each binomial expression has the same two terms, except that one term in one bracket is made negative.

$$ \left(a + b\right)\left(a - b\right) =  a^2 - b^2 $$

The distributive law can be used to expand expressions similar to the following:
* $\left(x + 3\right)\left(x - 3\right)$
* $\left(x + 4\right)\left(x - 4\right)$
* $\left(x + 5\right)\left(x - 5\right)$
* $\left(x - k\right)\left(x - k\right)$

Instead of expanding using the FOIL rule, we can quickly get the expansion by square both terms. So we have:
* $\left(x + 3\right)\left(x - 3\right) = x^2 - 9$
* $\left(x + 4\right)\left(x - 4\right) = x^2 - 16$
* $\left(x + 5\right)\left(x - 5\right) = x^2 - 25$
* $\left(x - k\right)\left(x - k\right) = x^2 = k^2$
