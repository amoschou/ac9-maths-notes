# Distributive law

> Before reading about the distributive law, you need to know the following:
> * Definitions: *term*, *factor*
> * Times tables up to $12\times 12$
> * Multiplying algebraic terms, collecting like terms, and simplifying algebraic expressions
> 
> Remember:
> * A *term* is a part of an expression that is separated from other parts by addition (including $+$ and $-$ signs).
> * A *factor* is a part of an expression that is separated from other parts by multiplication (including $\times$ and $\cdot$ signs and invisible multiplication).
> 
> Examples:
> * The expression $4x^2 + 2x - 4$ has three terms, which are $4x^2$, $2x$ and $-4$ (The negative is included in the term).
> * The expression $5x\left(x + 2\right)\times 3x$ has factors which include $5$, $x$ and $\left(x + 2\right)$, $3$ and another $x$.

The *distributive law* is:

$$ a(b+c) = ab + ac $$

We use it to *expand* brackets. Expanding brackets is a type of algebraic technique. To use this law, there needs to be two or more terms inside a set of brackets, and a factor outside the brackets.

The distributive law can be used to expand expressions similar to the following:
* $5(x+2)$
* $7(x-2)$
* $4(a+2)$
* $k(x+6)$

Each term inside the brackets is multiplied by the factor outside the brackets. Often, the expanded terms can be simplified. So we have:
* $5(x+2) = 5x + 5\cdot 2 = 5x + 10$
* $7(x-2) = 7x - 7\cdot 2 = 7x - 14$
* $4(a+2) = 4a + 4\cdot 2 = 4a + 8$
* $k(x+6) = kx + 6k$
